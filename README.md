# FTorch_coupling_examples

## Usage
This repository provides two examples of FTorch coupling: 


These examples provide complete demonstrations of how to use FTorch to couple various neural network implementations in pytorch using Fortran. 

- [CNN-simple](CNN-simple): Train a simple CNN to predict y = x + 1 mapping where x is a 2D tensor of random values between -1 and 1 of size (bs, 1, 20, 20), where domain size is 20 * 20. Runs inference in Python and Fortran and checks that error is within an acceptable tolerance. 

- [FNO-1D](FNO-1D): Train a simple FNO-1D network to predict the sin wave `sin(2Ï€x)` given an input of some dummy values and a uniform grid of x-positions on `[0, 1]`, and the target sine wave. Run inference in Python and Fortran with the same dummy values and unform grid. 

## Installation

Install FTorch as described [here](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch). Then compile examples:

Installation and running instructions are provided in each example README. The cmake command will look something like (if using LibTorch only). Use PyTorch if desired. 

```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/libtorch/share/cmake/Torch/;/path/to/FTorch/lib/cmake/FTorch/"
```
